# [Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/)
This is a repo for all of my Morsels exercises.
# [Week 1](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/add/add.py)
The purpose of the exercise was to add n matrixes together. This exercse made use of: the built-in zip function, raising errors, and set and list comprehension extensively.
# [Week 2](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/circle/circle.py)
The purpose of this weeks exercise was to create a Circle class that would calculate the radius, diameter, and area of a circle with a given radius. This exercise made use of class decorators; such as, the property and setter decorators. It also made use of the magic method __repr__ to change how the representation of the Circle object.
# [Week 3](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/edit_csv/fix_csv.py)
This weeks exercise I struggled with, mainly due to the fact that I was unsure what was meant by the '--in-quote' argument. Overall, this was a good exercise as I learned how to work (read and write) with csv files and how to handle command line arguments. Modules used were: csv and argparse; which, are all from the standard libary.
# [Week 4](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/tail/tail.py)
This was a very simple exercise which made use of interators and indexing. I would have a liked a more challenging exercise.
# [Week 5](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/count_words/count.py)
This was easier exercise that drew from some more intermediate level concepts; such as: functional programming and regular expressions. This exercise could have been done in one line by importing the Counter object from the collections module.
# [Week 6](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/Morsels/blob/master/point/point.py)
This weeks exercise made use of operation overloading (add, sub, mult) and magic methods.
