## [Week 1 - Add](add/add.py)
The purpose of the exercise was to add n matrixes together. This exercse made use of: the built-in zip function, raising errors, and set and list comprehension extensively.
## [Week 2 - Circle](circle/circle.py)
The purpose of this weeks exercise was to create a Circle class that would calculate the radius, diameter, and area of a circle with a given radius. This exercise made use of class decorators; such as, the property and setter decorators. It also made use of the magic method __repr__ to change how the representation of the Circle object.
## [Week 3 - Edit CSV](edit_csv/fix_csv.py)
This weeks exercise I struggled with, mainly due to the fact that I was unsure what was meant by the '--in-quote' argument. Overall, this was a good exercise as I learned how to work (read and write) with csv files and how to handle command line arguments. Modules used were: csv and argparse; which, are all from the standard libary.
## [Week 4 - Tail](tail/tail.py)
This was a very simple exercise which made use of interators and indexing. I would have a liked a more challenging exercise.
## [Week 5 - Count Words](count_words/count.py)
This was easier exercise that drew from some more intermediate level concepts; such as: functional programming and regular expressions. This exercise could have been done in one line by importing the Counter object from the collections module.
## [Week 6 - Point](point/point.py)
This weeks exercise made use of operation overloading (add, sub, mult) and magic methods.
## [Week 7 - Deep Flatten](deep_flatten/deep_flatten.py)
This weeks exercise made use of generators and recursion. 
## [Week 8 - Parse Rangse](parse_ranges/parse_ranges.py)
This weeks exercise made use of generators.
## [Week 9 - Suppress](suppress/suppress.py)
This weeks exercise made use of generators, decorators, context managers, and various python modules.
## [Week 10 - Ordered Set](ordered_set/orderedset.py)
This weeks exercise made use of OOB techniques - inheritance and abstract base classes; additionally, algorithm analysis (**big O**) and data structures were also required. 
## [Week 11 - INI ðŸ¡† CSV](ini2csv/ini2csv.py)
This weeks exercise made us of command line arguments, config files, and csv files. The standard libary packages used were: *argparse*, *sys*, *cvs*, and *configparse*.
